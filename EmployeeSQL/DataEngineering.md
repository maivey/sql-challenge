## Keys:
1. Emp_no in Employees is unique, that is, there is only one employee number per employee. Thus, emp_no is the primary key for Employees. 

    - Emp_no in Dept_Emp is a foreign key to the primary key emp_no in Employeesâ€” that is, the values of emp_no in Dept_Emp match the values of the primary key emp_no in Employees. 

    - Emp_no in Titles, Salaries, and Dept_Manager are all foreign keys to the primary key emp_no in Employees. 
2. Dept_no in Departments is unique, that is, there is only one department number  per department. Thus, dept_no is the primary key for Departments. 
    -  Dept_no in both Dept_Manager and Dept_Emp are foreign keys to the primary key dept_no in Departments, since they matches the values of dept_no in Departments.

### Setting Current Dates:
Since the tables dept_emp, dept_manager, and titles tables show to_date as year 9999 for employees currently working there, change the to_date to current_date for those employees. 
- For example:

    - update titles set to_date = CURRENT_DATE where extract(year from to_date) = 9999;
